Implementation of LOFTY_DEFER_TO_SCOPE_END(). This cannot define a move constructor (and delete the copy
constructor), because if F is a lambda it will lack means for the destructor to check if it’s been moved out
(no operator bool() support); instead, just don’t declare any move/copy constructors or operators, and rely on
the compiler to implement RVO so not to generate more than one instance for each call to
LOFTY_DEFER_TO_SCOPE_END(). */

/*! Allows to execute a statement at the ed of the enclosing scope, regardless of in-flight exceptions. This
is functionally equivalent to a try … finally statement in Python, Java and other languages, or Golang’s defer
keyword.

@code
int i = 1;
{
   ++i;
   LOFTY_DEFER_TO_SCOPE_END(--i);
   risky_operation_that_may_throw();

// At this point i is guaranteed to be 1, even if an exception was thrown.
@endcode

This works by encapsulating the statement in a lambda with automatic by-reference capturing, which is then
stored in an object whose lifetime will track that of the enclosing scope; when the object is destructed, the
lambda is executed. In order to avoid violating Lofty’s (and common sense) requirement that destructors never
throw exceptions, the statement contained in the lambda should only perform simple, fail-proof tasks, such as
changing the value or a local or global variable.

@param stmt
   Statement(s) to execute when the containing scope ends.
