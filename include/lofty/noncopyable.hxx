/*! Makes a derived class not copyable.

Derive a class from this for maximum compatibility instead of explicitly deleting copy constructor and copy
assignment operator.

This utility class is affected by a known MSC18 (Visual Studio 2013) bug, due to which for that compiler Lofty
will override std::is_copy_constructible with a fixed version.

With MSC18, Microsoft introduced a completely broken std::is_copy_constructible that makes one wish they
didn’t: it returns true for classes with private copy constructors[1], classes with deleted constructors[2],
and classes composed by non-copyable classes[2].

The only way of fixing it without breaking MSC’s STL implementation is to override and enhance it with Lofty’s
version, making the latter fall back to MSC’s broken implementation. In the worst case, this might make it
report classes as non-copyable when they are, but it will (hopefully) not report non-copyable classes as
copyable.
