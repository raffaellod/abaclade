/*! @page coroutines Coroutines
Asynchronous code execution via cooperative multithreading.

Lofty supports asynchronous code execution via preemptive multithreading (see @ref threads) and via
coroutines, a form of cooperative multithreading alternative to the confusing “callbacks waterfall” pattern.

Just like threads are created by instantiating a lofty::thread object with a function to run in the new
thread, coroutines are created by instantiating a lofty::coroutine object with a function to run in the new
coroutine. Unlike threads, coroutines won’t necessarily start executing immediately.

Upon instantiation, coroutines are scheduled to run on the current thread’s lofty::coroutine::scheduler
instance; if none was attached with lofty::this_thread::attach_coroutine_scheduler(), a new instance is
created and attached to the current thread.

Once one or more coroutines have been instantiated and implicitly scheduled to run, it’s the application’s
responsibility to give control to the scheduler by invoking lofty::this_thread::run_coroutines() on at least
one of the threads attached to that scheduler.

If an exception escapes from a coroutine, the scheduler that was running it will terminate any other 
coroutines associated to it, and will then proceed to throw a similar exception in the containing thread,
possibly leading to the termination of the entire process (see @ref threads).

If a thread is interrupted by an exception while executing lofty::coroutine::scheduler code, the scheduler
will terminate every coroutine associated to it, and then throw a similar exception to the caller of
lofty::this_thread::run_coroutines(), eventually leading to the effect described above. */

/*! @page interruption-points Interruption points

@ref coroutines and @ref threads in Lofty are safely interruptible using a built-in mechanism.

Calling lofty::coroutine::interrupt() or lofty::thread::interrupt() will cause the object on which they’re
called to receive an exception of type lofty::execution_interruption, which will be thrown at the earliest
time the coroutine or thread calls lofty::this_coroutine::interruption_point() or
lofty::this_thread::interruption_point(), respectively.

Interruption points are used to dispatch other kinds of exceptions, such as those originating from external
inputs, such as Ctrl+C. The thrown exception in these cases will be of a subclass of 
lofty::execution_interruption.

The following functions and methods implicitly define an interruption point:
•  lofty::this_thread::sleep_for_ms() / lofty::this_coroutine::sleep_for_ms();
•  lofty::this_thread::sleep_until_fd_ready() / lofty::this_coroutine::sleep_until_fd_ready();
•  All I/O operations performed on lofty::io file-based stream classes;
•  All I/O operations in lofty::net classes.

Interruption points should be avoided in destructors: if an exception is causing stack unwind in a coroutine
or thread, and lofty::this_coroutine::interruption_point() detects a pending interruption, a second exception
will be thrown, resulting in a call to std::abort(). */

   this_coroutine::sleep_for_ms() or other coroutine sleep functions; if the coroutine is already blocked on
   such call, the effect will be immediate from the coroutine’s point of view.

   Interruption will only occur when the scheduler is able to schedule the target coroutine; in a
   single-threaded scheduler case, this means that a coroutine calling interrupt() on another coroutine should
   then follow with a coroutine sleep function call to allow the target coroutine to be scheduled and
   interrupted as requested. */
