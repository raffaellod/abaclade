// Persistent storage support (a.k.a. no-SQL database).

/*! TODO: refine design and implement :)

General design:

•  “Server-domain” denotes a component that should be runnable indifferently on the same machine as the
   client, or on a remote machine.

•  Server-domain UID generator; each instance of a persistable class will get an UID upon construction.

•  When a pointer to a persistable class is needed, clients must use special persistable shared smart pointers
   which have both UID and memory address (if loaded) of the target object.

•  When a persistable pointer is accessed via such smart pointer and the pointer’s memory address is nullptr
   but the UID is non-zero, a “load” class method of the pointed-to class (it’s a smart pointer, so it knows)
   is invoked, returning a real instance which is then bound to the pointer which, being shared, automatically
   makes the object visible to every client holding a reference to it.

•  The “load” class method of a persistable class sends a request to the server-domain storage server,
   providing the instance’s UID and the name of each persistable scalar data member (string, integer, float,
   blob). Empty/default data is never stored; defaulting is handled on the client side, in the translation
   layer between persistable class and storage server.

   All non-scalar persistable data members of a persistable class have to use the persistable shared smart
   pointer described above; this allows to have on-demand loading for persistable class hierarchies.

•  The “unload” class method of a persistable class – TODO: when is this invoked?

•  When the reference count of a persistable shared smart pointer drops to zero, the “free” class method of
   the persistable class is invoked to discard the storage server’s data related to the object.

•  Caching:
   •  Client read caching: once an object is loaded, the class instance acts as a local cache for the object.

   •  Client write caching: TODO: perhaps a class can decide whether writes to persistable members are written
      immediately (write-through) or only when the “unload” method is called?

   •  Server read caching: TODO: while the server might not have a use for a read cache, it needs a special
      preload cache, discarded quickly if not used. The server probably also needs a row metadata cache, to
      keep in-memory metadata for the most recently/often used rows – see below.

   •  Server write caching: TODO: maybe writes should be grouped in batches, to reduce the number of waits for
      locks when a large number of rows is written at once?

•  The server-domain storage server stores (UID, key, value) triplets (rows).

   •  Sequential access speed-up: since most keys will be always be read in the same sequence order due to
      being part of the same persistable class instance, each row will hold a reference to a “preload” row
      that should be loaded while the data for the current row is processed (after being loaded) and returned.
      Ideally, this should allow to load an object of any size keeping the highest parallelism between disk
      and processor usage.

   •  Relational access speed-up: since many objects will always be retrieved in the same order due to the
      class hierarchy, the “preload” metadata could be used cross-object.

      However, in order for this to be self-adapting (load order might not be known at design time), the
      storage server should store a weighted list of rows accessed after another one is, storing a reference
      to the heaviest (most likely) row in the “preload” metadata, but also storing and constantly updating
      the weight of other accesses.

      •  This could keep only the top N (e.g. 8) permanently on disk, but as long as the row is in the server
         cache, many more preload candidates can be kept; when the cache needs to be flushed, the top N will
         be updated as well as the top “preload” row metadata.

      •  Weighting: TODO: what makes a good candidate for preloading?
